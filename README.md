## Functionality includes over the basic requirements of the project:
1. Displaying all the markers of earthquake and city on the map.
2. Triangles are for the city markers  and all others for earthquakes.
3. Different colors for different earthquake markers on the basis of their depth.
4. Displaying additional information besides the map to indicate the type of marker.
5. Clicking a marker will hide all other markers except those which are in the threat circle and another click will make all other markers visible again.
6. While running the program, it sorts the earthquake markers on the basis of their magnitude and show them from the highest to lowest on the console.
